<h2>Panthers. Animals. Worldwide</h2>
<h1><center><b>They Need Your Help</b></center></h1>
<center>
<p> Everyday millions of animals go without food and without a home.
 There is always something that we can all do to put in our fair share.
 You can donate to your local animal shelter, get involved with the community, and many other ways as well.
 If you are willing and able we encourage you to adopt.
 Nothing can permanently get these animals off the streets except a warm loving home. Here at P.A.W.
 we will help you every step way and find the best animal for you. </p>

<p> This is Pancake previously named Miranda.
 Her owner Zoe and Pancake share a truly sacred bond.
 Zoe was heartbroken due to the passing of her previous feline friend and wasn’t ready for another one.
 Zoe and her father were not looking forward to it but her sister still brought them down to the shelter.
 Disapproving of her cats her sister were picking, none shared the same bond with her, zoe and her father were getting ready to leave.
 As they were walking out they noticed Miranda. She played with her for a bit and felt that deep connection.
 “When we were getting ready to leave, she started meowing loudly until I returned.
 I decided to get her because she was so cute! I changed her name from Miranda to pancakes because I was hungry for pancakes that day.
 She loves it.” With their bond being secured Zoe and Pancake became the best of friends.
 She is shy but when a camera is on her she never fails to shine.
 They love to play tag and “lay around the house being bums together.”-Zoe Alexander </p>
